# Student-Success-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project examines how behavioral and demographic factors, like weekday alcohol consumption and past failures, impact academic success in students. Through statistical analysis, key insights into student performance were identified, offering potential strategies for educational support.

## Objectives
- **Gender and Failure Rates**: Analyze failure rate differences by gender.
- **Influence of Alcohol and Failures on Grades**: Assess if weekday drinking and past failures predict final grades.
- **Correlations and Comparisons of Grades**: Evaluate correlations between early-term and final grades, and compare mean grades across subjects.

## Methods
1. **Chi-Squared Test**: To test gender differences in failure rates.
2. **ANOVA and Tukey's HSD**: To analyze the effects of alcohol consumption and failures on final grades.
3. **Correlation and T-tests**: To assess the relationship between grades across terms and subjects.

## Tools
- **R**: For statistical analysis and visualizations.
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `car`.
